This project requires a basic understanding of p5.js and object-oriented programming. p5 is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences. It creates a drawing canvas in the size specified and appends it to the HTML page. The two main functions used are `setup()` and `draw()`. The `setup()` block runs once and is typically used for initialization. `draw()` runs repeatedly, and is used for animation. The symbols in this recreation are largely comprised of *Katakana*, which are characters that represent syllables in Japanese and Ainu. These characters can be repesented with Unicode as there are 96 available characters in the Katakana Unicode block.
